PR Document Helper
Travel History, Address History, Gap Detection, Export-Ready Tables
Summary
PR Document Helper is a small, offline-first tool that helps Canadian immigration applicants build clean, continuous Travel History and Address History tables with automatic gap and overlap detection, then export them as attachment-ready CSV and PDF.
The core pain it solves: IRCC forms and portals often require long date ranges (for example travel history for the last 10 years or since age 18) and expect continuity with no unexplained gaps, but most applicants end up juggling spreadsheets, PDFs, and memory.

Problem Statement
Applicants need to provide accurate, continuous timelines for travel and addresses, often across many years. Manual entry is error-prone, especially for:
gaps (missing months)
overlaps (two addresses covering the same dates)
inconsistent date boundaries (end date earlier than start date)
“I don’t remember exact dates” situations
IRCC guidance includes travel history requirements (IMM 5562) and other sections where IRCC explicitly says to avoid gaps in history tables.

Goals
Make it fast to build Travel History and Address History in the formats applicants actually submit.
Prevent common timeline mistakes before submission (gaps, overlaps, out-of-range entries).
Generate clean exports that can be uploaded as supporting documents.
Non-Goals
Not legal advice, not a replacement for IRCC forms.
No cloud sync in v1.
No automatic retrieval from passports, emails, airlines, or border databases in v1.
No direct “fill IRCC PDF” automation in v1 (maintenance risk, brittle).
Target Users
Primary Persona: DIY PR Applicant
Filling PR portal forms or requested supplementary tables
Has multi-country travel and multiple addresses
Wants confidence their tables have no gaps and export cleanly
Secondary Persona: Immigration Consultant or Lawyer Assistant
Needs standardized client intake tables
Wants consistent exports and fewer back-and-forth corrections
Adjacent Persona: PR Card Renewal and Citizenship-Planners
PR card renewal workflows also include address history requirements with “account for each month” and “leave no gaps” style language.

Citizenship applicants often keep travel logs and IRCC provides a travel journal as a memory aid.

Market Evidence
IRCC reports 483,640 new permanent residents admitted in 2024, showing a large ongoing population moving through PR-related processes.

Competitive Landscape
What Users Use Today
Generic PDF editors / “fill online” sites
They help fill forms online but do not focus on validation, gap detection, or producing standardized attachment tables.

Official IRCC tools (adjacent, not PR table builders)
Citizenship physical presence calculator and travel journal help remember trips, but they are not PR travel history table builders. 
eServices

Spreadsheets, templates, and community advice
Forum and Reddit threads show people asking for templates and struggling with what format to use when asked for travel history tables.

There are also DIY spreadsheet projects (for example a GitHub travel log aimed at citizenship-style tracking), which validates the need but does not package the PR-specific workflow.

Differentiation
PR Document Helper is not “another template”. It is a validator and exporter:
timeline engine that guarantees continuity
“fix it” suggestions (auto-fill missing gap row)
attachment-ready PDF and CSV exports
Product Scope
Core Modules (v1)
Travel History Builder (IRCC style)
Address History Builder (IRCC style)
Timeline Validator (gap, overlap, range checks)
Export Engine (CSV, PDF)
Optional Modules (v1.1+)
Personal History Builder (activities timeline aligned with IRCC expectations for continuous history)

“Request a CBSA Travel History Report” helper page with instructions and a place to reconcile entries (no data import in v1).

Functional Requirements
FR1: Project Setup
User creates a “Profile” (local only):
name (optional)
UCI placeholder (optional)
timeframe rule:
“Last 10 years”
“Since age 18”
custom start date
Travel history requirement language commonly references “last 10 years or since 18”. 
Canada

FR2: Travel History Table
Columns (editable, configurable):
From (date)
To (date)
Destination (country, optional city)
Purpose (dropdown + free text)
Notes (optional)
UX requirements:
fast add row
duplicate row
paste multiple rows from clipboard
bulk edit purpose
sort newest to oldest and oldest to newest
FR3: Address History Table
Columns:
From (date)
To (date)
Country
Province/State
City
Address line (optional)
Postal/ZIP (optional)
Notes (optional)
UX requirements:
“Still living here” toggle that sets To = Today (or export date)
IRCC explicitly discusses how to handle “to” dates if you still live at an address. 
IRCC
FR4: Validation And Warnings
Validation runs live and on export. It produces:
Errors (block export unless overridden):
end date before start date
invalid dates
overlaps (two entries covering same time)
Warnings (allow export with acknowledgement):
gaps in coverage within selected timeframe
missing required fields (destination blank)
suspicious micro-gaps (1 day gaps) depending on chosen date boundary rules
IRCC guidance and help content repeatedly emphasize “no gaps” in history tables in certain workflows.

FR5: Gap Fix Suggestions
When a gap is detected:
show exact missing range
offer “Add filler entry” button:
Travel: “No travel (in country of residence)” entry
Address: “Same as previous address” or “Unknown, add note” entry
FR6: Export
Export CSV for Travel and Address
Export PDF:
clean table layout with header metadata (Profile name, generated date)
page breaks
repeated table headers per page
optional footnote area for explanations
FR7: Import
Import from CSV (user’s old spreadsheet)
Smart mapping for common column names (From, Start Date, Date From, etc.)
Non-Functional Requirements
Privacy And Security
Offline by default, all data stored locally
“Export only” workflow supported with no account creation
Optional encrypted local database (recommended)
Clear disclaimer: not affiliated with IRCC, no legal advice
Performance
Must handle 2,000+ rows without UI freezing (power users with lots of travel)
Exports under 3 seconds for typical datasets (<300 rows)
Reliability
Auto-save
Versioned backups (local snapshots) so users can roll back changes
User Experience
Primary Screen Layout (One Window)
Top segmented control: Travel | Address | (Personal History later)
Left: table editor
Right: Validation panel
“Errors” section
“Warnings” section
“Fix suggestions” buttons
Bottom bar:
Import
Export CSV
Export PDF
Core Flows
Create profile → choose timeframe rule → start filling table → resolve errors → export
Import old spreadsheet → map columns → validator highlights issues → export
“I don’t remember dates” flow: user enters approximate dates, marks row as “estimated”, validator allows export but flags for review
Data Model (High Level)
Profile
id
name, optional metadata
timeframe rule (start date logic)
Entry (TravelEntry, AddressEntry)
startDate, endDate
fields per table
flags: estimatedDates, notes
Validator produces:
Issue
type (gap, overlap, invalid)
range (start-end)
affected rows
suggestedFix actions
Technical Approach
Option A: macOS App (Recommended For Trust)
SwiftUI UI
Local persistence: SQLite (GRDB) or Core Data
PDF export: PDFKit or custom drawing
Pros:
best privacy story
fast native table editing
Cons:
more Apple-specific development
Option B: Web App (Fastest Iteration)
Next.js or similar
Local-only storage (IndexedDB)
PDF export via client-side library
Pros:
easiest distribution
easiest iteration
Cons:
harder to win trust for sensitive data unless you are very explicit about local-only

Risks And Mitigations
People interpret it as immigration advice
Mitigation: strong disclaimers, link to relevant IRCC instructions (read-only references) and phrase guidance as “formatting and validation”, not “what you should claim”.
Form and portal requirements vary by stream
Mitigation: keep exports generic “attachment tables”, offer presets but let users customize columns.
Trust barrier due to sensitive data
Mitigation: offline-first, no accounts, transparent “data never leaves your device” design.
If you tell me which platform you want first (macOS app or web app) and whether you want to cover just Travel + Address or also Personal History in v1, I’ll turn this PRD into an implementation checklist with a strict “build this, not that” scope and a data schema you can drop directly into code.
